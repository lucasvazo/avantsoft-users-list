## AvantSoft - Technical Test
Objective: Create a table fetching a users list from a http request and create a paginated table with 10 users per page. Use of Laravel is mandatory for this project.

### Steps

1. Setup XAMPP for running a local server.
2. Download and install Composer to set up Laravel environment.
3. Setup remote repository.
4. **Start Project:**
4.1 Create basic pages controllers.
4.2 Configure pages using Blade.
4.3 Set up global styling for the project.
4.4 Create table structure.
4.5 Create logic for retrieving the users data.
4.6 Create the logic for table pagination.
4.7 Finish Styling.


### Technical Dificulties or Limitations

- Setting up local environment server.
- Disparities between different versions of Laravel.
- Dealing with package manager besides npm, with limited knowledge.
- Dealing with PHP syntax, althought it is very close to my 'main' language, JavaScript.
- Setting up bootstrap. Of all the dificulties encountered, this one I was not able solve efficiently.


### Points to improve

- **Better MVC folder structure**: Since no 'model' was present on the project, I could have simulated a use of a database, storing the retrieved data and setting up a simulated database to better.
- **Styling with BootStrap**: The method for styling was plain css, since the dificulties encountered on running Bootstrap on the Laravel version which I installed would take me a lot of time to fix.
